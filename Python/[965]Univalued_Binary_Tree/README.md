# Univalued_Binary_Tree

Difficulty: Easy

# Question Description

A binary tree is uni-valued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the given tree is uni-valued, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
![alt text](image-1.png)
Input: root = [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val < 100
