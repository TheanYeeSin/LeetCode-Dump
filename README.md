# LeetCode-Dump

A repository that stores all my LeetCode code.

## Installation

```
git clone
```

### To create new folder

```
python generate_leetcode_folder.py <id> <name>
```

## Language Used

- Python

## Purpose

Mainly to document my LeetCode solution.

## Background

In 2023, after my final university exams, I took on the challenge of daily LeetCode sessions until I landed a job. A month later, thanks in part to my practice, I secured employment. Deciding to maintain the momentum, I continued my LeetCode routine but not daily anymore due to other commitment.

## Remarks

My code may not be the best practice, so take it with a grain of salt. Also, I might miss a day due to forgetful nature. Thank you.
